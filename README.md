# Dynamical Systems
Code and report for the homework and the final project for the Dynamical Systems course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana.

## Homework Problem Statement
Construct the canonical actions and angles and find the frequencies as functions of the canonical actions for the elliptical billiard. Find the conditions for the periodic motion. Hint: The second integral of motion is the product of the angular momentum with respect to each foci, describing the boundary of the billiard.

## Final Project Problem Statement
Study the transport of point elastic particles in a billiard that is shaped as a long, coarse channel. One of the walls is straight,
 while the other is expressed as a Fourier series, where the coefficients are normally distributed independent random numbers with mean zero and variation inversly proportional to the coefficient's index.
Study the possiblity of the diffusion of the x coordinate of the particle after a long time i.e. calculate the variation of the x coordinate as a function of time, averaging over many initial conditions or realizations of channel coarseness. Study the possibility of normal or anomalous diffusion.
Does there exist a critical value of the proportionality coefficient in variation above which we get global chaos in the phase states (destruction of all KAM tori)? Perhaps you can determine the critical value with the help of the Chirikov criterion.
